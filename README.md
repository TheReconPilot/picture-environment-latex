## Running it locally

You can download everything and run the documentation locally on your computer. Also useful if you wish to contribute.

### Opening directly on the Browser

Download the Archive of this Repository using the _Download ZIP_ button in the _Code_. Alternatively, [click here to download](https://github.com/TheReconPilot/picture-environment-latex/archive/master.zip). 

Extract the ZIP archive and open the `docs` folder, and open the `index.html` file on your browser. That's it.



### Using Docsify

Since this project uses [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/), you may want to want to visit the documentation. This has a live reload functionality so every change made in the documents reloads the pages when saved. 

```bash
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

Download the repository, or clone it with 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheReconPilot/picture-environment-latex.git
```

And then in the main folder, run 

```bash
docsify serve docs
```

This will serve the documentation on `localhost:3000` by default. 

You don't really need Docsify installed to be able to contribute. 



### Using HTTP Server

You need to be in the `docs` folder for this, where the `index.html` file is located.

- With npm: `npx http-server`
- With python-3: `python -m http.server`
